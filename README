This python script lets you choose and plot information from STS together with related topographic image.

It works with STS (.VERT) files created with Createc Software (PSTMAFM), although topographic and dIdV images have to be exported 
with gwyddion as ASII data matrix (.txt) to allow for parsing with this script. 
Please choose 'dot decimal seperator' & 'add information header' in the export dialog.

Start it with python3 and follow the graphical file selection dialog. If you don't have a dIdV channel recorded don't select one.

For each image you will be asked for a contrast range which you choose and save from the popup windows. 
Close them after you have made your choise.

The resulting images are plotted and saved as pdf for further use.

To change the graph appearance, some source code editing is needed (Colorbars, Scalebars, En/Disabling Ticks ...) but most of it is obvious
and already added as comment. Feel free to experiment.

Batch processing of whole folders will (maybe) be added in the future.
